Project: SDE2

Purpose: Implement the CYK parsing algorithms in ocaml using
				 functional programming. Learn the paradigm of pure functional
				 programming, implement a functional version of an interesting algorithm
				 devliver working functional programming-based software based upon 
				 specifications and learn ocaml.

Contents: sde2.caml, sde2.log

"sde2.caml"
	- This is the ocaml file which contains the functions 3.1 through
		3.7 which are used in SDE2

"sde2.log"
	- Contains examples and output of how to use created functions in file "sde2.caml"
		for functions 3.1 through 3.7
